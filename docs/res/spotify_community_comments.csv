BradAcord,Music Fan,2018-06-20 02:23 AM,This is a great idea.  It could possibly generate a temporary playlist that wipes itself clean once a week or so (giving you a week to actually go and listen later).,17
BradAcord,Music Fan,2018-06-20 06:14 AM,"I like this idea a lot.  Here is a mock-up of what this could look like.  Very similair to how on the Discover Weekly playlist there are options on the far right to either ""Like"" (with a heart symbol) or ""Don't Like"" (with a cancel sign), there could be a little clock icon symbolizing ""Later"" added to the far right of every song when hovered over.  Clicking this symbol could add it to a special playlist called ""Listen Later"".  This playlist could have chosen songs stored there for a set amount of time.",43

slushead,Newbie,2018-06-25 09:37 PM,"I myself created a private playlist I named ""Haven't listened yet"" and each time I discover new artists that I like and when I see new albums I want to listen to, I add them to this playlist. I'm also subscribed to a lot of playlist that add new albums every week and to make sure I do not miss anything, I will often add songs from those new albums so I can listen to them later. I'm not saying this is a bad idea, but I think it is already pretty easy to manually do what your idea is in the way Spotify works right now.",5

birdgirl8,Casual Listener,2018-07-02 04:49 AM,"I just found your idea after I had already posted mine. They're very similar. You can actually save any album you want. The only problem is that the songs from that album are added to your ""Songs"" section, so therest no good way to listen to them separately. I can't go in and listen to my old reliable favorites without having to skip a bunch of songs I've never heard before. My suggestion was to add a ""Save For Later"" section where one can save albums of interest.",6

Temporarily saving albums or making playlists help circumvent this a little, but it's a bit tedious deleting them afterwards.Hope we can keep this alive long enough to where they may finally decide to implement it.",1
Funkermonster,Newbie,2019-04-16 08:25 AM,"Update: Some time ago I was told about this 3rd party site with a similar feature via itsMagic Queueplaylist. It'll auto-remove songs added to it if listened to for at least 30 seconds (doesn't work immediately though, takes around 15 to sometimes 110 min to delete the songs from what I'm seeing). Easy way to bookmark songs without having to save/like or delete them all later lolMight be worth a look for anyone who still wants this feature🙂",0
jb_bryant,Roadie,2019-04-26 09:59 PM,"Rdio handled this perfectly. It's the main thing I still miss from Rdio. When you queued an album, it would queue the whole album as a block or chunk. If I had repeat on, it would repeat the album or playlist I'm currently listening to. But if I didn't have repeat on, it would just go through my whole queue including all albums. I loved it because I'd just go through my heavy rotation and queue up albums that look like something I may be interested in.  I would be in heaven if something like this came to Spotify.",0

metopa,Visitor,2020-01-04 11:17 PM,"The approach with a custom playlist is a bit inconvenient since sometimes you want to check out an album or even a whole artist. The playlist becomes overpopulated rapidly. Also, it's a pain to manually delete the whole album from the playlist each time you've checked it out. I really like the variant with a custom page, like it was introduced in the original feature request:https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Check-Out-Later-Section/idi-p/1336423  Another way to implement this is to introduce generalized playlists (say, called ""Collections""), where you can add a whole album or an artist as a single unit. Then users would be able to have multiple ""Check it out"" collections, each devoted to a different genre, etc. But I think Spotify will never implement such a thing since they are trying to avoid ""complex"" featured (there's probably a reason for it).",4
JesperBB,Newbie,2020-01-20 03:28 PM,"Totally agree with @metopa.  A custom playlist as some mention easily gets big and messy - And I easily forgets that I have music saved for another time.  I would love for Spotify to implement features around the ""Save for later"" functionality. I'm just brainstorming but possibly stuff like; prompts that reminds me ""Hey, you saved this album 1 month ago - What about listening to it now?"". Or maybe I could set the prompt myself like; ""I would like to save this artist for Monday afternoon"" (when I'm working).  Having a full section in the application based around ""Saved for later"" could feed into Spotify's profiling of music taste, so I see endless value created for both users and Spotify🙂",3
MaxieWoxy,Roadie,2020-01-20 04:38 PM,"I disagree that using a playlist to save stuff to listen to later is tedious or messy.  I've been doing it for years and I listen to a ton of music and use that method daily.  I call the playlist my ""to do."" It's part of my routine to work my way through it each week. Right-click, add to playlist, done. Doesn't get much easier than that.  I would much rather see Spotify devote time and resources to other enhancements and/or fixes than to waste them on something that isn't really needed.",0
Smythee,Newbie,2020-01-21 05:15 AM,Hard disagree. Yr daily chore of messing w/Spotify playlists would seem tedious to many subscribers w/less free time.

cfgrrl,Newbie,2020-09-18 01:37 AM,"Was directed here by twitter after suggesting my idea. Here's my take on the idea/feature...The other feature idea I had was a ""Listen Later"" playlist. It would be kind of like YouTube's ""Watch Later"" but with listening to music. You could add songs, albums, artists, etc to the playlist to listen to later. Maybe you could play through it chronologically or on shuffle? Or maybe on ""radio mode"" which would be kind of like shuffle but a bit more organization to the playlist order from song to song in terms of style/genre/etc and maybe it also brings in similar songs as well? And things would stay on the ""Listen Later"" playlist until removed by the user so you could decide if you like it or not. There could be a heart button for liking it and adding it to your liked songs. And then the usual option of adding it to new/pre-existing playlists. And then it would stay pinned to the top of the playlist section for easy access, just like the ""Liked ""Songs"" one.",1
MaxieWoxy,Roadie,2020-09-18 02:00 PM,"Pretty much everything you said is already available if you create your own""Listen Later"" playlist.All this time I still cannot understand why people keep saying this is aneeded feature when you can already do it.",1
Smythee,Newbie,2020-09-18 11:19 PM,"YouTube has it, FB has read later -- are you confused that they added thisfeature? The reason they added it is convenience and simplicity if youreally are confused.

MaxieWoxy,Roadie,2020-09-19 04:41 AM,I have no idea what you're trying to say because it is expressed so poorly.There is no need for a Listen Later feature to be added to Spotify. Justcreate a playlist called Listen Later and add songs to it. Bam. Done.,0

MaxieWoxy,Roadie,2020-09-19 11:26 PM,There's no poor reading comprehension. Your response was so meandering andlacking in logic that whatever point you were trying to make was completelyineffective.It's just silly to me that someone is trying get a solution developed thatalready exists. I want Spotify developers to focus their time on newfunctionality and new technology. Keep raising the bar. Keep innovating.Don't be spending time adding a button that does the same thing we canalready do.,0
Smythee,Newbie,2020-09-20 07:57 AM,"Aw, come on. Be honest. You just like to argue on the Internet. Anyway,let's get into details of how this feature could work vs. your ""solution.""I apologize in advance for meandering, but details are important with UIs.Say a new Jojo Siwa LP appears in my ""New releases for you"" and I'm pumpedto listen to it, but can't at that moment. I click on the LP, then I clickon ""add to playlist"" so I can put it on my ""listen later."" playlist But Ihaven't touched my ""listen later"" for a while. So I have to scroll throughmy playlists, find ""listen later"" and add it.Later in the day, I see there's a new Mercury Rev. I want to hear that, tooso I take the same steps. Three new Guided by Voices come out in a month. Ilather, rinse, repeat.If I do this for a week or two my ""listen later"" playlist becomes ameandering mess of Jojo Siwa, Guided by Voices, Alex Cameron demos, etc.etc.Now, imagine Listen Later functionality like this: Click on the Jojo Siwaalbum, click on the three buttons and there's a ""Add to listen later"" below""Go to radio."" I don't have to scroll to find the ""listen later"" playlist.It's just added.Further, when I go to my library on my phone, there's a ""Listen Later"" tothe right of ""Albums."". When I click that I don't have a garbled playlistof Jojo Siwa and GbV, I have a list of albums, singles, etc. If I want tolisten to Mercury Rev, I click on that. No need to to scroll past the JojoSiwa.tl;dr Your ""solution"" is a clunky workaround. My idea is something manyother users want.",5
mucde,Newbie,2020-10-12 02:07 PM,"I've tried using a playlist but it doesn't work, as you can only add individual songs or all the songs from an album.I like the idea of being able to save things at a higher level.  I know you can follow an artist, but very quickly you end up with too many.  Being able to do a similar thing with a new artist you've discovered, or for an album would be ideal.Having a new playlist type which was at that higher level (artist or album) would allow people the flexibility to do whatever they wanted.",1
MaxieWoxy,Roadie,2020-10-12 02:18 PM,"Not sure I understand this, If you want to follow an artist, add an album(or song) to your ""listen later"" playlist. Now you have a record of theartist and can check their other music out anytime you want.",0
mucde,Newbie,2020-10-12 03:55 PM,"It's about the number of items.  If you add albums for 10 artists, you'll have 100+ tracks in your ""listen later"" playlist.    Which is much tougher to search through, and maintain (on Windows you have to right click on each track to remove from a playlist, easier on a phone).If you browse an artist on a phone you see the individual albums, and it's really quick to find the one you want to listen to.  If you do the same for the same artist on Windows, the album view is expanded to include all the tracks, and it takes much longer to find anything.Perhaps having different variations for following an artist (customisable or things like favourite, like, check out) or for saving an album to your library (favourite, like, check out) is another option.",1
AdamDamon,Spotify Star,2020-11-09 11:32 PM,"I think this is a great idea! Usually when I find music that I'd like to listen to later, I add the albums of interest to temporary playlists, which I can return to in the future; however, over time this can cause my library to become cluttered. A feature for saving albums for later would be a great alternative to this process!",2

feistyla,Music Fan,2021-03-12 09:47 PM,"Agreed!  I was pointed to vote for this one, after I wrote  a similar suggestion ... mine was just more  detailed in explaining  the need to make sure they don't just say ""that's what your save to library is for""... since the reason for this is to differentiate a to-listen bucket, separate from the  favorites bucket.And... because contrary to what other commenters here think... you can't add Albums or playlists to a 'listen later' playlist... and some device interfaces don't even have the ability to view or manage your library by any custom groupings.

MaxieWoxy,Roadie,2021-03-14 09:03 PM,"Years later and it still cracks me up that people continue to ask for something you can already do pretty easily. That's probably why Spotify has never taken the time to add something redundant.  You can add albums to a playlist. If the functionality is not in the Roku or Kindle app, sorry about your luck but pretty sure they are never going to invest much in those ""lite"" app versions.  I typically annually average listening to more than 100 songs per day. I add songs and albums to my ""To Do"" playlist all the time and it's very, very easy to manage. Sometimes I add one song to remind me to go back and check out an artist fully when I have time. I also have a ""give another spin"" playlist for things I checked out and want to maybe dive deeper or listen further before I decide to save them to favorites or other playlists.  Again, very easy to manage music with playlists. Also very easy to move entire playlists into another playlist if I want to.",0
Bennif,Newbie,2021-03-17 09:52 AM,"Hello MaxieWoxy,  that´s not the same. If you add an album to a playlist, you see lots of songs in the Playlist, but not the album itsself.At what if I want to add an Artist to my Playlist?? It doesn´t work. So where is the problem to mark an Artist, an Album or just a song with a flag listen later???  So if you can provide a soliution, where I can put an Artist in a playlist with his whole work, let me know.

MaxieWoxy,Roadie,2021-03-17 03:53 PM,"I am sorry if you took the response negatively. Admittedly, it isfrustrating that people keep asking for something that is easily donetoday.

It's not a complex solution.I think your house painting analogy was a little off. No one is telling youwhat color your house should be.

I shouldn't be frustrated by the fact that there is what I perceive as a very easy solution to the perceived problem when people keep asking for something in spite of that. If someone could explain to me what is so hard about using existing playlists to help you save stuff for listening to later, that would probably help. But that has never happened. As a logical person, creating a playlist called ""Listen to Later Artists"" and adding a song by the artist is all I need to keep track of artists I want to listen to later. Open up the playlist, click on the artist name and BOOM, you're there. To mucde's point, unsubscribing is my answer so I can be blissfully unaware of more of these requests.🙂So thanks cheers to you for that suggestion!",0
feistyla,Music Fan,2021-03-17 08:31 PM,"To clarify forMaxieWoxyand anyone else who is confused.... this need of 'Save for later"" or ""Check it out later""  is so you can save Playlists or Albums to check out later... which you CAN""T add to a playlist, because that just lumps the songs up... totally different than this need.The same way there's a ""Heart"" icon to quickly save something to your favorites library.... There needs to be an equal but different icon,  so you don't muddy up your favorites with stuff you haven't decided on yet!  AND.... the need is to do it from any device quick and easy. So... an icon like a check or ""list"", parallel to the 'heart'.(Not all interfaces let you access folders or playlists to choose when 'liking' something, so it's all just a big bucket despite the talked-about folder-feature for playlist-organizing .... I tried that approach but it's a cumbersome interface even on the laptop, and not available at all via KindleFire or Roku-app use .   I've made a separate plea regarding that problem)",3

Only downside is that it doesn't work with the new UI upgrade yet, so I'm debating whether I want to drop the Bookmark extension to try the new UI.

No, funny, but stop claiming your approach is the solution you can not either. It is to despair, but you already had a realization, and it applies to you: I just feel sorry for people who have a solution that they are unwilling to accept simply out of stubbornness or hurting their pride.

ElderofSmoke,Newbie,2022-08-25 09:29 PM,This would be such a game changer especially when hunting down new releases you intend to listen to. The “O! I should get on to this!” gets lost very quickly where moments and priorities shuffle ones intent. Everything forgotten. Not all people are equal in music taste so if Spotify can either remind or let you bookmark your “wish list” to ease into the moments you are waiting for but forget due to a fast paced lifestyle: this will surely be a breather from trying to remember what you wanted to listen to.,2
Jodie653,Casual Listener,2022-11-11 10:19 PM,This is a great idea! I add songs to a TBD playlist and they stay there until I decide whether to like them or not. The problem is after I hit like I then have to find the song in the playlist and remove it. It would be great to have a list that I can add songs or whole albums to quickly that would remove songs from the list automatically when I hit like. We could even swipe one way to like and the other way to just remove the song from the list.,2
sdntran11,Visitor,2022-12-07 03:11 AM,It would be great if there was a way to bookmark or save songs and albums for later without having to like or add them to a playlist. Sometimes friends suggest music that I would like but I forget to listen to them or sometimes an artist I like will release a new album and I will put it off to listen to later and forget. So if there was like a folder or section within my library that contains songs and albums I've 'bookedmarked' for later would really help. I also think that it would make me spend more time on the app.,2

The current solutions — liking an album (which might be the same as adding to your library), following an artist, or adding to a playlist) — aren't doing the trick. Currently, I'm just searching artists and albums and relying on my search history to find stuff which is kinda goofy.I am usually learning about new music from quick interactions with people, articles, or forums and I just need a quick way to signify that it's something I should check out when I have more time to dive into it. I don't want to like an artist or an album because I don't know if I like them yet and I don't want that to influence any algorithms or suggestions. And I don't want to add them to an existing playlist nor create a new one as that takes too much time. I just want a simple way to remind myself to check out certain artists.",3

Then it'll keep track of what you've listened to, how you've rated it, you can arrange by tags and preloaded metadata like date published, tracklist, etc. I'm taking the time this wknd to manually load in my saved albums so now my saved stuff can be reserved for my favorite music.

zerocontrast,Regular,2023-11-01 04:07 AM,"Nearly 2,700 likes on this one and still only marked as a 'Good Idea'?  Essentially all video streaming services have something like this, the ""My List."" It could be done as a new/separate category in 'Your Library', a section of music that doesn't integrate exactly with your actual library, akin to the new-ish Local Files option, except in this case you could view/sort by artist, album, etc.  I too started a ""Listen Later"" playlist which is a so-so solution. It's a bit cumbersome when adding whole albums at once (because it creates such a long list to scroll through), especially if there's an individual song buried in there somewhere. And it certainly isn't practical if you would like to mark another separate playlist as 'listen later'.  Please implement this.",3
probablygoodideas,Casual Listener,2023-11-02 02:57 AM,"I really hope this idea isn't anywhere else, if so, I apologize. If you're reading this, I bet you'll like this. Many, Many times I have come across a playlist that I want to try out or a friend sends me an album or a song I haven’t heard, but I don’t have time to listen to it or I’m listening to something else at the moment. However, I tend to forget about newly discovered music like this that I want to listen to unless I save it to my library, but I would prefer to not have those tracks and playlists taking up space there. The feature I’m proposing would be something like a separate tab in My Library, something akin to the ‘watchlist’ feature found on many streaming platforms, where you could save songs, albums, or playlists for later and easily find them when you want to try them out, but then they aren’t clogging up your library.

Greenfire468,Visitor,2024-09-07 10:05 AM,A section separate from what you already have liked for songs or albums or podcast episodes that are things you want to listen to and don't know if you like yet. Like a watch later section where you can go and find something that someone recommended to you but didn't have the time or weren’t in the mood to listen to at the time. I’ve found myself wanting to listen to an album but not at that exact moment and not having a place to save it that wasn’t my liked albums.,0
icedlatte02,Visitor,2024-09-08 07:43 PM,"Like how Netflix has a 'Watch List,' Spotify should have a 'To Listen' section. Artists often release albums, EPs, etc., as a complete body of work to be listened to. The story and emotions of an album are best conveyed when the listener can listen to it through completely. However, it's easy not to have the time to actively listen to a long piece of work. I think it would be helpful to have a 'To Listen' section that is separate from my playlists, liked songs, and liked albums, so they are easy to distinguish. In 'My Library' where you can filter 'Albums,' 'Downloads,' etc. it would be great to have a 'To Listen' filter. Right now, I have a note in my Notes app that I'll refer back to when I have the time to dedicate to listening to a full album.  https://medium.com/@shelrochaleal/the-art-of-creating-an-album-9e06213c3c87",1
aaaaaaah_,Newbie,2024-09-28 07:51 AM,"I listen to a lot of albums, so I have a lot of albums in my Spotify library. When I’m looking for a new album to listen to, there’s a lot of albums I have to go through in order to decide what exactly it is I want to listen to. What I would love is to keep the favorites section, so I can keep track of the albums I love, and also a “Listen Later List” so I can keep track of the albums I want to listen to in the future. The Listen Later List would work just like a watchlist on any streaming service, but this way it’s much easier to keep track of what I have and haven’t listened to. Please please PLEASE implement this as a feature, it would make things so much easier",1
n3rds,Visitor,2024-09-28 08:24 AM,"I have had a Spotify Family Premium plan for 4 years now and this is the first time I encountered an issue where my family member has been removed from my plan due to address changes.  They received an email that they need to confirm their address but they did not notice it the soonest. A 7-days notice that's been sent via email is too short and there's even no WARNING or NOTICE in their Spotify Application about it. They're not a fan of checking their emails regularly so they missed that Notice causing their removal from the plan.  I would let this slide since I have a subscription to various music platforms such as Apple Music and YouTube. However, towards the end of August, another family member got the same issue.  I had already fixed the issue by having them contact the Spotify support team so they can have some kind of prompt where they can re-confirm their address.  Hence as a suggestion to fix this issue and to avoid inconvenience to users, there should be some kind of prompt/warning/notice in the app itself so that the user can resolve it on their end.P.S. Not everyone is checking their emails regularly unless it is very important. From an application perspective such as Spotify, it is easy to miss if the email we are receiving is important or not since there are those kinds of advertisements, announcements, etc.  Instead of surprising your end users who are in a Premium account and having them kicked out by just sending a 7-day email notice, you should also add and enhance your application which would give your users a warning if there are any changes or address confirmation that needs to be done immediately. You should take Disney+ and Netflix as an example. It prompts the user immediately if the device they are using needs to be confirmed that it belongs to the same household. Spotify should also have the same prompts and notices in their application to avoid the hassle with the end user.",0

Many times I go to spotify to listen to something specific, and I don’t want to check a recommended album at that moment but because it looks interesting I want to be able to save it for later. That would also be useful when I discover albums via websites/articles/etc and I want to open spotify and save them in a place where I have new stuff I want to listen to.I usually make a playlist for that, but it’s annoying when I want to remove albums that I’ve listened to. Then I have to remove the songs one by one.",1
riyu,Newbie,2024-10-24 02:24 PM,"It would basically work like YouTube's watch later. Of course, you can simply save the album at once, or create a specific playlist just for that album, or any other workaround, I'm specifically talking about a section for albums that you decide to listen to later with more time and calm, or for whatever reason. I think it's important to separate the albums that I already have saved and listen to from those that you might be curious about eventually. Playlists are the same problem, you just accumulate more stuff. After all, YouTube also has a playlist option, but even so, everyone ends up using watch later for a video that caught their attention. Having an integrated tool with this option would make it much easier to discover new music, and I find it curious that there isn't anything like that yet.",7

alvaroaguerri,Newbie,2024-11-01 12:11 PM,"Hi all, I was just thinking about the fact how many times I have been recommended artists, albums or songs and I have forgotten their names, so they have fallen into oblivion and I have never had access to that content again unless they repeat it to me later. This applies to any kind of recommendation whether it's from a friend or a tik tok you come across out of the blue. So I simply propose that it would be a good idea to implement a new feature that allows you to save content to be listened to in the future, without needing to be added to your library or saved to a specific playlist for it. I'm in digital product design and development so I guess I think about these things more. I imagine it as something similar to Youtube's ""Save to watch later"" functionality. Even so, I think it could be very useful because there is so much varied content and not only videos like Youtube. Thanks for reading my idea, let me know what you think!",2

If I save it to my library I'll never remember to get back to it and I prefer to keep that space curated anyway.

bjk33,Newbie,2024-12-06 03:11 AM,"No disrespect, but the dev behind such a feature is not extensive building off ‘your library.’ Of course one could compile a giant playlist of songs/albums to listen to, but the UI is poor and inefficient. Simply being able to access the album interface as normal, but organizationally separate from ‘Your Library’ would be much cleaner. Other services offer similar functionality, it is not beyond the pale. Plus, such a feature is not mutually exclusive with your suggestions. This is a popular idea, hence all the upvotes, yours are good as well. The issue is Spotify is not concerned with much beyond milking engagement and churning rev out of existing customers, I don’t see them implementing anything that reduces clutter, enhances the UI, or eases navigation/modularity, it’s all farm engagement, short-form video, promote spam. This kind of internecine fighting does very little. They’ll raise prices and we will all keep paying for it…",1

Because then if someone recommends you a song or album, you have a way of flagging it to come back to late on without it affecting what Spotify thinks your tastes are, because you might not like the recommendation.
